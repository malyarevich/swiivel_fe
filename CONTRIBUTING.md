Your merge request should:

Include a description of what your change intends to do

Be a child commit of a reasonably recent commit in the development branch

Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e. no merge commits in your MR)

Have clear commit message 

Follow the code conventions described in Angular styleguide https://angular.io/guide/styleguide

Task is supposed to be done only after MR is applied

To avoid line ending issues, set autocrlf = input and whitespace = cr-at-eol in your git configuration
